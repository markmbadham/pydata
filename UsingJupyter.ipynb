    "### What is The Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that is used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at Project Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects because\n",
    "in this case, a **Notebook** is able to\n",
    "* integrate code and its output into a single document\n",
    "* that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media.\n",
    "\n",
    "This in-built workflow promotes iterative and rapid development, making Notebooks an increasingly popular choice for modern data science, analysis, and increasingly science at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a loose acronym representing Julia, Python, and R. These three programming languages were the first target languages of the Jupyter application. Notebook technology has grown since to support many other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is The Jupyter Notebook app?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook app allows you to edit and run your Notebooks via a web browser. The application a) can be executed on a PC without Internet access or b) it can be installed on a remote server making it accessible through the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **kernel** is a program that runs and introspects the user’s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for multiple other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **dashboard** is specifically designed for managing Jupyter Notebooks by facilitating exploring, editing and creating. And is also used to manage the kernels - identifying which ones are running and allowing for them to be shut down if necessary.\n"

    "Jupyter Notebooks is packaged with The Anaconda Python Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is the most widely used Python distribution for data science and comes pre-loaded with the most popular libraries and tools. Some of the biggest Python libraries wrapped up in Anaconda include NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib, though the full 1000+ list is exhaustive. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the requirements to run The Jupyter Notebook is either Python 2.7, or Python 3.3 or greater. The general recommendation is to use the Anaconda distribution to install both Python and the Jupyter Notebook application. \n",
